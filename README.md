This project is a sample project that I did to practice AVR coding.

The goal was to setup a UART protocl to establish a connection using serial ports with PC. Sending below commands and gettings results:

- led:{index}{status} -> LED:01 -> set LED 0 to 1
- alcd:{text} -> Show text on lcd.
- add,mul,div,sub,mod:{numbers list} -> add, multiply,... numbers and getting result back by terminal-> add:2 3 4 0





#### The Simulation folder contains files to simulate the project using Proteus, and Code folder contains CODEVISION project files.
